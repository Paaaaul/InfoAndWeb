	  The issue of securing the communication of data from those to whom it isn't intended is an age old one, as people have always found worth in stealing other people's information, whether it be for personal or finiancial gain. As a result of this, cryptography has also been used in some form or another for a very long time.

		In this page, an outline of the the history of cryptography will be made and show how it has lead to the current state of using public key cryptography to encrypt vast amounts of data transmitted over the internet.

<h3>The Origins Of Cryptography</h3>

<p>
	It is known for certain that encryption of data existed in one form or another since the first formal civilisations started settling. For example, is is recorded that Egyptian scribes used abnormal heiroglyphs to conceal messages from prying eyes. Furthermore, a very high profile usage of cryptography can be found in the Roman period, where Julius Caesar used what is now referred to as the <strong>Caesar Cipher</strong> to encrypt messages that he was sending regarding his military activities.
</p>

<p>
	This was a relatively simple, yet effective algorithm. A message can be encrypted with the Caesar Cipher by going through it and shifting the characters back by three spaces in the alphabet. As shown below, to the naked eye, this renders the message as complete nonesense, making it not so immediately obvious what the message is meant to mean to anyone who intercepts the message without knowing the way in which it was encrypted.

<p>
	This is a secret message, so it is encrypted.
